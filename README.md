This is the interactive two player game(My Final Project) which I had made when I had started learning a bit more about Js in a course from udemy,
As i was curious after week 8 of CS50.
So this is an interactive game where 2 players have to roll the dice and the one who reaches the score of twenty first wins the game.
The Instruction to play this game are given in instruction.md file. Kindly look at those to understand how to play.

This game is View is made out of HTML, CSS, AND JavaScript, And Implemented controller using Python and Flask framework.
The beautiful Layout and the several dynamic changes are stored in classes in css.And with the help of JS they are applied over the HTML elements.
DOM had a major role in it with its functions such as querySelector and eventListener. I hope you'll enjoy it. Cheers!
