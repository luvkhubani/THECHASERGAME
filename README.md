THE CHASER
This is the interactive two player game(My Final Project) which I had made when I had started learning a bit more about Js in a course from udemy,
As i was curious after week 8 of CS50.
So this is an interactive game where 2 players have to roll the dice and the one who reaches the score of twenty first wins the game.
The Instruction to play this game are given in instruction.md file. Kindly look at those to understand how to play.
