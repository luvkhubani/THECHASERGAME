This website was developed when I was doing the course of Javascript by Jonas Schmedtmann on udemy.
1) The game consists of two players.
2) First player gets the chance first and he has to roll the dice and have temporary score until the player tap on hold to add its temporary score
to its final, which is considered to win the game.
3) The game's dice/roll function generate random dice roll everytime using some algorithm.
4) If you get a 1 in dice then you'll loose your temporay score hence your loss.
5) Once we have clicked on hold the chace is given to the next player until either he/she may click on hold or
get a 1 on the dice.
6) Enjoy Playing. Cheers!
